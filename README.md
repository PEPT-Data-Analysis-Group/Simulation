# Simulation
*VelocityPlotter.py* allows one to plot the velocity vector field within a fluid
undergoing Coaxial Couette Flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid
is free to flow between two infinitely long cylinders with radii *r1*
(for the inner) and *r2* (for the outer). The outer cylinder remains stationary,
whilst the inner cylinder rotates at *rpm* revolutions per minute, inducing a flow
in the fluid.
